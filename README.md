This code will run a simulation with the parameters of Figure 2A of Kolodny Creanza Feldman (PLoS Computational Biology, Dec 30 3016 online ahead of print). Parameters can then be changed in ParamConfiguration.java. Note that the simulations are stochastic and each run is unique, so  figures produced will not exactly match those in the manuscript.
